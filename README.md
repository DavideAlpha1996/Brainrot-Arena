# Brainrot Arena

**Brainrot Arena** is a turn-based meme-survival mini-roguelike.  
Fight as a chaotic brainrot creature (starting with a killer cappuccino ☕💀) and survive endless waves inside a tiny *5x5 tactical arena*.

Level up, increase HP / Attack / Action Points, and outplay the madness.

Made for game jam submission. More features planned if players enjoy it!
